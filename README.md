A simple but effective boilerplate to ecommerce platafforms created with the next.js framework, it's still at the embryonic stage. 
I'ill update a docker file to this, but for now just running a npm install on any linux should work.
In order to run the project, run the following commands:
npm install
npm install auth@beta
npm run dev
